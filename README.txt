When studying and working on my portfolio, I love using the pomodoro method.
This method of studying has you working in short bursts and take small breaks inbetween these bursts.

One might work for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break, then after 4 rounds of this one takes a longer 
break of 30 minutes.
There are many different timers on the internet that you can use, but I find myself to be distracted by 
it sometimes so I decided to make my own timer
featuring art that I have made.

 Python functions, 
 A easy to navigate UI,
